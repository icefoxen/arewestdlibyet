A list of useful and relatively mature crates for various tasks, for you need a de-facto-standard way
of doing stuff.

Basically, if there's an obvious answer to a common "how do I do X" question, or if someone might ask
"Why isn't X in std?", X should go here.  This shouldn't become [awesome-rust](https://github.com/kud1ing/awesome-rust), we have awesome-rust for that.

Another excellent source is [stdx](https://github.com/brson/stdx), check it out.

Rules:

* At most two crates that do more or less the same thing
* If there's no halfway decent docs and readme, leave it out
* If it's not a go-to solution for the task it's doing, leave it out
* If you're not sure, leave it out

If you have a suggestion, amendment, flames, or other communication, open an issue.  Or better, a pull
request.

To do: Short descriptions, links to crates, note whether or not it is pure rust,
better tables, link to arewe*yet...
