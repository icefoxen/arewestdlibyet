A list of useful and relatively mature crates for various tasks, for you need a de-facto-standard way
of doing stuff.

Basically, if there's an obvious answer to a common "how do I do X" question, or if someone might ask
"Why isn't X in std?", X should go here.  This shouldn't become `awesome-rust`, we have awesome-rust
for that.

Should we limit the number of crates here?  Ideally there would be a small number of crates for each
category.  The focus is also on fairly fundamental tasks... hmm.

To do: Short descriptions, links to crates, note whether or not it is pure rust, better tables...
